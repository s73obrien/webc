# Files installed by packages. If you add anything here, also update
# /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/exclude-files to make sure dpkg does not install
# these files in the first place (and doesn't refer to them in its .list
# files).
# Technically just having the dpkg exclude should be sufficient, but
# these files are ignored too just to be sure (also when configure or postinst
# scripts create files in these directories).
